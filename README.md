Explain real world difference of abstract classes and interfaces

Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and have methods that are not implemented and this methods must be overridden in the subclass.its like a general type of object. while Interfaces are contracts that defines set of behaviors to be shared in classes without implemention.An interface cannot have a constructor so this means it cannot be instantiated.An interface just provide set of methods without a specific implementations of this methods,this methods are then used in classes.

Real world implementations Abstract class A real life analogy of an abstract class is a an abstract class of vehicle.The vehicle class represent many types of them.This type of vehicles can represent a subclass eg.a truck The vehicle class only provides the common methods to share among the subclass eg drive() method.abstract classes must start with the key word abstract.

Interfaces A real life analogy of an interface is like swimmable.This can provide entities that can swim and this can implement both submarines an fishes which dont belong in a common class. An interface can be shared across different classes.

unklike Abstract classes in vehicle class analogy which only share to related subclass.
